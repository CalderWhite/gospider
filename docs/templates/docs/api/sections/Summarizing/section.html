  <p>
      Summarizing is the core function of superspider. An algorithm summarizes the contents,
    and outputs a table-like json payload.
  </p>
  <div id="Summarizing-Usage" class="subgroup">
    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <p>
      In short, here is the format for requesting a summary.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="dracula lang-HTTP">GET http://{app-domain}/api/summary?url={url} HTTP/1.1</code></pre>
    <div class="bs-docs-example">
      <p>
        For this instance, say the server is running locally, and you wanted a summary of <a href="https://c9.io">c9.io</a>.
      </p>
      <pre><code class="dracula lang-http">GET http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/summary?url=https://c9.io HTTP/1.1</code></pre>
    </div>
    <h4>Things to avoid</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Putting quotes around the url like so:<br/>
          <pre><code class="dracula lang-http">GET http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/summary?url="test.com" HTTP/1.1</code></pre>
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div id="Summarizing-Payload" class="subgroup">
    <h2>Payload</h2>
    <p>
      Since this api is still small, the only return mime type available is JSON.
      The json is formatted as follows.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="lang-json">
{
  "time" : {time}, //The time this was generated.
  "structure" : {structure}, // represents what scraping technique was used.
  "passages" : [
    [keywords,text] // passages contains an array of arrays, with keywords and a passage from the webpage.
  ]
}
    </code></pre>
    <div class="bs-docs-example">
      <p>
        Here's what a summary for  <a href="https://c9.io">c9.io</a> would look like.
